# DZI
A library and CLI utility for creating deep zoom images.

Deep-zoom images, or DZIs are a standard first published by Microsoft 
for storing and viewing very large images while being able to zoom and pan
without loading the entire image into the viewer.

See https://openseadragon.github.io/ for a reference implementation.

This crate is based on the excellent python implementation at
https://github.com/openzoom/deepzoom.py
